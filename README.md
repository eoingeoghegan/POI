# Project :
- "A “point of interest” (POI) is a location for which information is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates, a name, and a unique identifier, or more complex such as a three-dimensional model of a building with names in multiple languages, information about opening and closing hours, and a civic address. POI data has many applications, including augmented reality browsers, locationbased social networking games, geocaching, mapping and navigation systems.” http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/poiswg.
