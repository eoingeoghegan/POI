# Project:
- "A point of interest (POI) is a location for which information is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates, a name, and a unique identifier, or more complex, such as a three-dimensional model of a building with names in multiple languages, information about opening and closing hours, and a civic address. POI data has many applications, including augmented reality browsers, location-based social networking games, geocaching, mapping, and navigation systems." Source.

- So far, this app allows users to sign up and sign in to their individual page. They are then brought to a dashboard where they can add a category they're interested in. For this project, the user can view a category of walks by location. When clicked into, the user can enter details about walk routes.

- There is a user page that allows the user to update their username, email, and password. They can see their information at the top of the page, and it updates when changes are made.

- There is an admin page, which is basic but shows the users in the database. There is also an option to delete users here.

- The application allows for API creation, deletion, and retrieval of users in the database using Postman through the poiService.

- The application has three storeTypes, Memory, JSON and MongoDB for storing all the details.
