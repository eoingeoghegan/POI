# Project:

- "A point of interest (POI) is a location for which information is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates, a name, and a unique identifier, or more complex, such as a three-dimensional model of a building with names in multiple languages, information about opening and closing hours, and a civic address. POI data has many applications, including augmented reality browsers, location-based social networking games, geocaching, mapping, and navigation systems." Source.

- This application allows users to register, sign in, and manage points of interest (POI) in various categories (walks). After logging in, users can create, view, and update their walks and routes, as well as manage their account information. The app also includes basic admin features for user management and provides an API for interacting with the data. The application has three storeTypes, Memory, JSON and MongoDB for storing all the details.
